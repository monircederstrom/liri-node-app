# liri-node-app

This is app is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 
LIRI can take in 3 commands: "my-tweets", "movie-this", "do-what-it-says".

"my-tweets" allows you to view the last 20 tweets from my twitter page.

"movie-this" will allow you to research any movie. Type "movie-this" enter a space and then the movie you want to look up.

"do-what-it-says" will read through a random.txt file and run the movie-this function.

All the results will be seen in the terminal using node.js.
